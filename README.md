# Stencil Crafting Plugin

A Hytale Java plugin centered on Stencil Crafting workflows, with the Stencil Book as the in-game stencil tool.

### Configuring the Project
If you for example installed the game in a non-standard location, you will need to tell the project about that.
The recommended way is to create a file at `%USERPROFILE%/.gradle/gradle.properties` to set these properties globally.

```properties
# Set a custom game install location
hytale.install_dir=path/to/Hytale

# Speed up the decompilation process significantly, by only including the core hytale packages.
# Recommended if decompiling the game takes a very long time on your PC.
hytale.decompile_partial=true
```
